# EXTRACTION AND VERIFICATION FROM SEMI-CATEGORIZED DATA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting useful information from semi-categorized data and verifying its correctness. Semi-categorized data contains partial structure, such as CSV files with missing fields or text data with labels but inconsistent formatting.

The system extracts key information and verifies it using predefined rules.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract meaningful fields from semi-categorized data
- Verify data correctness and consistency
- Store verified data in a structured format
- Reduce manual data validation effort

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Many real-world datasets are semi-structured and contain incomplete or inconsistent information. Manual verification is time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates extraction and verification using Python.
